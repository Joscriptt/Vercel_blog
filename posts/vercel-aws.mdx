Next.js Conf exceeded all my expectations this year.

**110,000+ registered** and **55,000+ joined live** to watch the keynote and community talks. Hundreds of developers joined live in San Francisco, London, and New York.

This conference was unlike any I've attended before – we put _so much effort_ into creating a unique experience, both for those online and in person.

Building and growing a community is the most rewarding part of my role, and I'd like to take you behind the scenes on all things Next.js Conf 2022.

## Better ingredients, better pizza, Next.js Conf

'Twas the night before Conf™️ and we hosted a small community dinner at a local pizzeria. **It was invigorating.** Old friends getting back together after years – and new friends joining from around the world to talk JavaScript and the Web.

One person told me:

**"The food was good, the people were great, and the conversation was even better"**

Honestly, it doesn't get much better than that for me.

## We'll do it live¹

Our team sprinted towards the Conf finish line, trying to get everything ready for the big day. I told myself "Oh, we'll worry about the pre-show later, first we need to do [x, y, z]". Welp. Turn out preparing for things makes you more prepared.

It was kind of hilarious – Delba and I went to practice that morning and we both couldn't really make words come out of our mouths. A combination of nerves and excitement. I became stressed, 30 minutes before we were scheduled to go live in front of thousands of people.

But... the lack of scripting and planning actually led to a _great_ outcome. We truly did it live – it felt authentic. To warm up the conference before the keynote, Delba and I bantered back and forth about the upcoming day of talks and brought community members and conf speakers up on the stage.
